"""
This script generates PCG tables in batch. It consists of a loop that calls the `generate_table` function multiple
times, using different combinations of input arguments. The output tables are saved as CSV files with tab-separated
values.

Generated files are as follows:
    For each LN in LN_values (number of species; 10, 100 or 1000):
          |
          |-- For each N in N_values[LN] (number of groups; different for each value of LN):
          |        |
          |        |-- For each distribution of species between groups (Skewed or Even):
          |        |         |
          |        |         |-- For each community file (relative abundance distribution; lognorm or uniform):
          |        |                 |-- <species_distr>_<comm_distr>_N<N>_LN.csv

So, for every combination of number of total species LN and number of groups N, we will have files like :
|-- EvenGroups_uniform_N<N>_LN.csv
|-- SkewedGroups_uniform_N<N>_LN.csv
|-- EvenGroups_lognorm_N<N>_LN.csv
|-- SkewedGroups_lognorm_N<N>_LN.csv

Simulations (the next step):
    Each community (abundance table; see "simcomms" folder) will be paired with those PCG tables with the same number of
    species. This means multiple PCG tables per community. Each community will then be simulated with a varying number of
    groups + with a varying species distribution between groups (Skewed of Even)
    [We could also drop lognorm and use uniform communities only, or remake the lognorm ones; see Limitations]
    Each pairing will be simulated with many different dilution factors.
    Also, each abundance table actually contains 30 replicates, so everything will be simulated x30.

Limitations:
 - Leaves are randomly and evenly distributed between groups without checking their previous total abundance. If we have
   a lognormal community of 10 members and we choose to have 3 skewed groups (for instance, with final relative abundances
   of 70%, 20% and 10%), it might happen that this initial random distribution is very different from the final ones. In
   this example, group 1's 3 species might happen to sum only 11% of the total abundance, even when they have to grow to
   constitute the 70%.
      > This should not pose any serious problems.
      > However, maybe we should just use uniform communities for simplicity.
      > Which would mean crear una funciÃ³n nueva en el repo (predicting_fixation/1_datasets/generate_simcomms.R) similar a
      la de lognorm que ya hay (= un solo PCG) pero capaz de leer una pcg table existente.
 - No interactions yet.
      > Adding interactions means using a different script to create interaction tables. After that,
        we would need to make simulations for all combinations of:
   	  - Communities (distinct LN)
   	  - PCG tables  (with the same LN as the communities)
   	  - Interaction tables (with the same LN as the communities)
      > Furthermore, we would need to think about which kind of interactions we want (competitive, cooperative...) and
        between whom (inter-group or intra-group). In this case there would need to be more restrictions about which
        interaction table can be used for what community.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input variables:
- LN_values: a list with values for the "Number of Leaves" argument to be used in the `generate_table` function.
- N_values: a list with values for the "Number of Groups" argument to be used in the `generate_table` function.
- input_folder: a string with the path to the folder containing the community files. Community files should be named
    with the format "<GroupDistr>_N<N>_<community_name>_<LN>sp.csv", where <GroupDistr> indicates the way leaves are
    distributed between groups, <N> is the number of groups, <LN> is the total number of leaves and <community_name>
    is a unique identifier for the community ("lognorm" or "uniform").
- output_folder: a string with the path to the folder where the output tables will be saved.
